## 🏗️ About the Project

**Roll & Play Bot** is not just a bot; it is an RPG Engine designed to be robust, scalable, and modular.

This project was architected by **Matheus Pereira** (author of the **DREAM** and **MQ-AGI** architectures). The goal is to provide a solid technological foundation for tabletop RPG experiences on Discord.

### The Philosophy
* **The Engine:** Maintained by the core team. Focuses on stability, architecture, and clean code.
* **The Content:** Created by the community. We provide the systems (combat, inventory, dice); you build the worlds.
